# What this is

This is a simple and lightweight extension that automatically redirects you from YouTube video webpages to Invidious URLS of the same video. However, it won't redirect you if you are on other YouTube pages.

# Who this is for

This is mainly for people who are tired of YouTube ads and don't use Adblockers, OR, people who use adblockers but got blocked in YouTube because of the new "Adblockers are not allowed in YouTube" popup.

# Others
